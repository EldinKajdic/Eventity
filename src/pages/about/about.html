              The Eventity Program was started in 2012, following the rising numbers of robots buying tickets for events and retailing the purchased tickets for profit.

        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <small> We strive to end the mass retailing of personal tickets and aim to lower the official price of concert tickets. The Eventity Group works as a non-profit organisation.</small>        <div padding>

              Originally, The Eventity Group was created as The Identity Group. The application was first designed to only create and read QR-codes to
              enable identifying of students easier. After a while, it shifted direction towards becoming an application for musical events. The Eventity Program was
              founded by Eldin Kajdic in 2017.
